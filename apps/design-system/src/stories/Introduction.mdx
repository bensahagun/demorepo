# Demo Design System

Welcome to the Demo Design System documentation. This Storybook contains all the reusable components, patterns, and guidelines for building consistent user interfaces across our applications.

## Architecture

Our design system follows atomic design principles:

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, labels)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (search forms, card headers)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (navigation, layouts, feature sections)

## Getting Started

Browse the components in the sidebar to see:

- **Interactive examples** of each component
- **Props documentation** with controls to experiment
- **Usage guidelines** and best practices
- **Accessibility information**

## Packages Used

- **React** - Component framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** - Accessible primitives
- **Class Variance Authority** - Component variants
- **Tailwind Merge** - Class conflict resolution

## Development

```bash
# Start the design system
pnpm dev

# Build the design system
pnpm build
```

## Usage in Applications

```tsx
// Import atoms
import { Button } from "@demo/ui/atoms";

// Import molecules
import { DataTable } from "@demo/ui/molecules";

// Import organisms
import { DashboardLayout } from "@demo/ui/organisms";

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <DashboardLayout>
      <Button variant="primary">Click me</Button>
    </DashboardLayout>
  );
}
```

## Component Guidelines

### Consistency

- Use the design tokens defined in the Tailwind configuration
- Follow the established color palette and spacing scale
- Maintain consistent typography hierarchy

### Accessibility

- All components are built with accessibility in mind
- Keyboard navigation is supported where applicable
- ARIA attributes are included for screen readers
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines

### Performance

- Components are tree-shakeable
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Optimized bundle sizes
